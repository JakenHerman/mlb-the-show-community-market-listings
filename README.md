# Contributing
Happy Hacktoberfest! This project is meant to be an easy entrance for beginners to contribute to open source software. Almost all pull requests will be accepted, so whatever you think the project needs / could use - feel free to submit my way. There are some issues I have created to give you a head start on possibilities. Because this is meant to be for everyone, please only solve one issue per person. That doesn't mean you can't make extra pull requests, just don't hog the issues please.
